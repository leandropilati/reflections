When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When a colleague has developed some code in his/her branch that is still being worked, but you want to bring to your branch and experiment with
it, it would make sense to use the remote repo.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

this allows to group the commits with logical changes and have better control over the commits.
