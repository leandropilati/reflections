When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When a colleague has developed some code in his/her branch that is still being worked, but you want to bring to your branch and experiment with
it, it would make sense to use the remote repo.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

this allows to group the commits with logical changes and have better control over the commits.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Fork = copy a Github repo to my GitHub profile. This is useful when you want to try someone else's code without breaking it. only works in GiyHub
Clone = copy a repo to my working directory. Go
Branch = creates a separate branch to add changes and modifications without breaking master.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

if you are going to be offline (without internet connection) then you woould still be able to continue executing the commands and validating the changes.
